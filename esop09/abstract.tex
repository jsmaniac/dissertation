Just as some functions have uniform behavior over distinct types,
other functions have uniform behavior over distinct arities.  These
variable-arity functions are widely used in scripting languages such
as Scheme and Python. Statically typed languages also accommodate
modest forms of variable-arity functions, but even ML and Haskell,
languages with highly expressive type systems, cannot type check the
wide variety of variable-arity functions found in untyped functional
languages. Consequently, their standard libraries contain numerous copies of
the same function definition with slightly different names.

As part of the Typed Scheme project---an on-going effort to create an
explicitly typed sister language for PLT Scheme---we have designed and
implemented an expressive type system for variable-arity
functions.  Our practical validation in the context of our extensive
code base confirms the usefulness of the enriched type system.


%% Just as many functions have uniform behavior over all types of

%% emulated with copied code in typed languages.  As part of the Typed
%% Scheme project, we have designed a type system which handles rest
%% arguments of both uniform and non-uniform types, and which covers the
%% use cases required to typechecking existing Scheme code.  We also
%% sketch a local inference algorithm and describe practical experience
%% with the system.
