\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}

In this paper, we have presented a design for polymorphic functions
with variable arity.  Our system accommodates both uniform and non-uniform
variadic functions.
%We have also described how to integrate the
%system with the rest of the Typed Scheme language, as well as how to
%extend a local type inference algorithm to handle variable-arity
%polymorphism.
We also validated our design against existing Scheme
and Typed Scheme code.  Typed Scheme with variable-arity polymorphism
is part of the latest 
release of PLT Scheme (4.1), available from \Verb|http://plt-scheme.org/|.

In closing, we leave the reader with a final observation on the nature
of variable-arity polymorphism.  Many existing languages  allow
functions that accept a variable number of arguments, all of a
uniform type.  Such functions have types of the form $\tau^*
\rightarrow \tau$.  To accommodate variable-arity
polymorphism, however, we must lift this abstraction one level up.  For
example, given the type \scheme|(All (alpha ...) (alpha dotsa ->
Boolean))|, the \emph{kind} of this type is simply $\star^*
\rightarrow \star$.  So we see that \emph{non-uniform} variable arity at the
type level is reflected in \emph{uniform} variable arity at the kind level.
